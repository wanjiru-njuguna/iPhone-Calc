# iPhone Calculator Model.

In this project, I used HTML, CSS and Vanilla javascript to recreate the calculator on my iPhone.

The calculator works more like the windows computer. For example, if you press a few numbers with multiple dual operators in there, the calculator will give you the answer to the first two numbers.

Also, the number of digits that you can input like in an iPhone calculator have been limited to 9 and this goes for the result as well. If you try to input more numbers, they will not display. Also if the result of your calculations has more than nine digits, it will overflow.

In case you get overflow as an answer, you will not be able to do more arithmetic operations until you reset the calculator using the ‘AC’ button. This goes also for any division by zero. The output will be an error and if you try to do more calculations without resetting the button, the buttons will not work.
